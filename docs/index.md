# THE SEAI

![Saving lifes with artificial intelligence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XPi2/startmeapp-hackaton-lstm/master/docs/images/savinglifes.png)

## Why?
**TheSeAI** aims to **detect** and **save** drifting boats before it’s **too late**.
We are living a humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean Sea in the last years, which magnitude is unnoticed.
Here **Artificial Intelligence** could strive for good, adding eyes in the Mediterranean Sea in order to save lives.

Thanks to the collaboration of our team and the support of Huawei and Pais Retina
we have been able to develop a **Machine Learning open source software**.
This tool has the potential to **help NGOs** and civil search; rescuing operations in the Mediterranean sea.

## How it Works?

Our solution is based on **computer vision** technology.
We are able to automatically process **real time video information** from different data sources:
**drones**, **satellite** or **maritime webcams**.
This powerful technique will helps us to **detect dinghies**. 

Once the **algorithm** and technology are ready to work it could be **implemented** in to different **camera systems**,
for several platforms. Our objective is to have **automated drones** flying through the Mediterranean sea
to detect possible humans in danger. 

The steps to create **TheSeAI** are as follows:

1. –Getting the Data  
The first step is to check and label the necessary data. In this case aerial views of dinghy boats
2. –Deep learning and computer vision  
After labeling all the data, we train an Artificial Intelligence algorithm in order to identify the ships in real time.
3. –Real time prediction  
When the AI has learned to identify the boats it starts to predict in real time the boats. We create an additional dashboard to track it.
4. –Drone based solution  
Drones and satellites analyse the sea. The last step is to analyse the predictions and send help to the specific areas.

## TheSeAI Dashboard

**TheSeAI** platform includes a **dashboard** where humans can see different metrics about what the A.I. is **detecting**.
The platform will trigger an **alert** in case **one or more dinghies are detected** during a certain span of time.
Inside the platform, a real time video streaming of the drone's view is displayed together with the AI detections

> *“Execute our **algorithm, detect in real time** and get a the information in a **Dashboard in any device**”*

## Impact
Thousands of people are still trying to **reach Europe** searching **international protection** and **family reunification**.
At the same time many other people are moving to Europe for different reasons, including economic and educational opportunities.
We must make sure, each trip to Europe is **safe**.
